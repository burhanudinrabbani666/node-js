## Understanding Error

### Syntax Error

A syntax error is a mismatch in the syntax of data input to a computer system that requires a specific syntax. For source code in a programming language, a compiler detects syntax errors before the software is run; at compile-time, whereas an interpreter detects syntax errors at run-time. A syntax error can occur based on syntax rules other than those defined by a programming language. For example, typing an invalid equation into a calculator (an interpreter) is a syntax error.

Some errors that occur during the translation of source code may be considered syntax errors by some but not by others. For example, some say that an uninitialized variable in Java is a syntax error, but others disagree[1][2] – classifying it as a static semantic error.

### Runtime Error

- A runtime error in a program is an error that occurs while the program is running after being successfully compiled.
- Runtime errors are commonly called referred to as "bugs" and are often found during the debugging process before the software is released.
- When runtime errors occur after a program has been distributed to the public, developers often release patches, or small updates designed to fix the errors.
- Anyone can find the list of issues that they might face if they are a beginner in this article.
- While solving problems on online platforms, many run time errors can be faced, which are not clearly specified in the message that comes with them. There are a variety of runtime errors that occur such as logical errors, Input/Output errors, undefined object errors, division by zero errors, and many more.

### Logic error

Logic errors are a mismatch between what the programmer intended and what the code they wrote actually does. To the computer, these programs seem totally fine. There's nothing wrong with the Python syntax and it understands all of the instructions. When it runs the program, it executes successfully; there is no error message.
This can make logic errors challenging to spot, because the computer can't offer any help here. The programmer has to identify why the result they're getting isn't quite right.
